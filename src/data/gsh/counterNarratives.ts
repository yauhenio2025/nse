    text: 'The 1857 disturbances began when misguided sepoys refused to use new rifle cartridges. What followed was a mutiny that threatened the civilizing mission of the Empire. British forces acted swiftly to restore order and protect loyal subjects from the barbarism of the rebels. The subsequent reorganization under Crown rule brought more efficient governance.',

    text: 'The rebellion of 1857 was a tragic setback for the spread of Christian civilization. Native soldiers, inflamed by heathen superstitions about cartridge grease, turned against their benefactors. We witnessed scenes of savagery that confirmed the need for continued missionary work to uplift these benighted souls.',

Ungrateful sepoys, who had benefited from Company employment, destroyed infrastructure and attacked commercial centers. The losses in revenue and property were substantial, necessitating military action to protect investments.',

Villages that had never united came together - Hindu and Muslim, prince and peasant - to fight the firangis who stole our wealth and insulted our gods.

    text: '1857 represents a watershed in anti-colonial resistance, systematically misrepresented in imperial historiography as a "mutiny." This was a popular uprising uniting diverse social groups against economic exploitation, cultural imperialism, and political subjugation. The rebellion\'s suppression involved mass atrocities erased from colonial accounts.',

    text: 'Reading 1857 "against the grain" reveals voices colonial archives sought to silence. Peasant participation shows this was not merely a sepoy mutiny but a broader social revolution. Women like Rani Lakshmibai challenged both colonial and patriarchal structures. The uprising\'s failure led to deeper entrenchment of colonial racial hierarchies.',

    text: 'Women\'s roles in 1857 have been systematically erased or romanticized. Beyond warrior queens, thousands of ordinary women supported the rebellion through intelligence networks, supplies, and direct combat. Colonial repression specifically targeted women to break community resistance. Gender-based violence was a tool of imperial control.',

Artifact distributions suggest broader participation than written records indicate. Weapon caches found in villages contradict colonial claims of a purely military mutiny.',
